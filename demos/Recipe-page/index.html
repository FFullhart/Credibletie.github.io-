        <h1>French-Style Hot Chocolate</h1>
        <h3>
            This is the kind of hot chocolate you sip slowly. Thick, creamy, 
            and made with real chocolate, it feels straight out of a French 
            café. Simple ingredients, really good texture and flavor.

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <h3>MAKE THE HOT CHOCOLATE</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan over medium heat, add the milk, heavy cream, and
                brown sugar. Heat gently, stirring occasionally, until 
            steaming but not boiling.
        </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add the chopped chocolate and pinch of salt. Whisk continuously 
                until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth 
            and slightly thickened.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Pour into mugs and top with whipped cream before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>WHIPPED CREAM</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to
                a large bowl or stand mixer fitted with the whisk 
            attachment.
                    </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Whip on medium speed until the mixture thickens and soft,
            billowy peaks form.
        </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Stop mixing as soon as the whipped cream looks smooth and
            fluffy—overmixing will make it grainy and less smooth.
        </li>
        </ol>
