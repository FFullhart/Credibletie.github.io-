                American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language[5]
                that serves as the predominant sign language of deaf 
                communities in the United States and most of Anglophone 
                Canada. ASL is a complete and organized visual language 
                that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual 
                features.[6]

            <h2 class="text">History</h2>
            <p class="text">
                ASL originated in the early 19th century in the 
                American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, 
                Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. 
                Since then, ASL use has been propagated widely by 
                schools for the deaf and deaf community organizations. 
                Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL 
                users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American 
                ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, 
                including a number of children of deaf adults 
                (CODA) and other hearing individuals.

            <p class="text">
                Signs in ASL have a number of phonemic 
                components, such as movement of the face, 
                the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form 
                of pantomime, although iconicity plays a larger 
                role in ASL than in spoken languages. English 
                loan words are often borrowed through 
                fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is 
                unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal 
                agreement and aspectual marking and has a 
                productive system of forming agglutinative 
                classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to 
                be a subject–verb–object language. However, 
                there are several other proposals to account 
                for ASL word order.
