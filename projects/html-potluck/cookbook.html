        <h2>&nbsp;Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 fresh mangoes</li>
            <li>1 cup glutinous/sweet rice</li>
            <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp corn starch</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Soak glutinous/sweet rice for 2 hours, or up to overnight. 
                Drain water when ready.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Using a steamer, steam sticky rice for 20-30 minutes. 
                Check on the 20 minute mark. If rice is soft and not hard in 
                the middle, it is done.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If you do not have a steamer, shape aluminum foil into three
                equal size balls. Fill pot with water (see Note 1) and place 
                the aluminum balls on the pot.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place a metal bowl/plate (or a plate that can withstand the hot 
                steam) on the aluminum balls. Add drained rice to the bowl/
                plate.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bring pot to boil, and once it boils, cover pot, and cook for 
                20-30 minutes. Check on the 20 minute mark. If rice is soft and
                not hard in the middle, it is done.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                While waiting for rice to cook, slice mangoes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Prepare the sweet coconut sauce by bringing 1 cup of coconut 
                milk, sugar and salt to boil. Once it reaches a boil, bring 1/2 
                of the sauce into a small bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Combine 1 tbsp of coconut milk and corn starch, then add that
                into the pot to thicken the sweet coconut sauce. Boil for a few 
                minutes until sauce is thickened.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                When rice is done, add the non-thickened sweet coconut sauce 
                (the sauce set aside on Step 7) to rice and mix well. Set 
                aside and let it cool for 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once cool, place rice onto serving plate(s), pair with mangoes,
                and drizzle the thickened sweet coconut sauce onto rice. 
                Garnish with sesame seeds.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Serve and enjoy!

        <h2>&nbsp;Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 Homemade pie crust, , unbaked (my recipe makes 2 crusts, 
                so you can freeze the other crust)
            </li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup salted butter, , softened or melted</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>
                1 1/2 cups pecan halves, (can chop the pecans or leave whole)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare my perfect pie crust recipe and place pie dough in a 
                deep dish pie plate. Refrigerate while you prepare the 
                pecan pie filling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl cream together sugar, brown sugar, salt, 
                corn syrup, and softened (or melted) butter. Mix in the 
                eggs and vanilla.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Reserve a few pecans and stir the rest into the batter. Pour 
                into unbaked pie shell. Add a few of the reserved pecans on top 
                of the pie in any empty spots, to make it look pretty. Use a 
                small spoon to cover them with batter.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, then lower the oven temp to 
                350 degrees F and continue baking for about 50 minutes. Check 
                the pie half way through cooking and tent a large piece of 
                greased aluminum foil over the top of the pie. (I tent it high 
                so it doesn't touch the pie filling). You will know your pecan 
                pie is done when you can shake it gently and it is not overly 
                jiggly.  If it jiggles a lot when shaking, continue cooking 
                until the center is more set, 5-10 more minutes, or longer if 
                needed. Err on the side of cooking it longer rather than 
                shorter to ensure that the middle has set.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Allow pie to cool completely for several hours before cutting 
                and serving. Or refrigerate for 1-3 days, until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li>
                Serve and enjoy!

        </ul>
        <h2>&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
        <h3>&nbsp;Preperation:</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 160C/320F (standard) or 140C/295F 
                (fan/convection)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Get a 20cm/8″ springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN 
                (Note 4), butter lightly and place a square piece of 
                parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into 
                the springform pan.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Butter and line the side of the pan.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>&nbsp;Cheesecake Biscuit Base:</h3>
        <ol>
            <br>
            <li>
                Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Blitz until fine crumbs (Note 5). Add butter, briefly blitz 
                until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li>
                Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly 
                spread it out over the base and up the walls.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use something with a flat base and vertical edges 
                (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall 
                almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
            <h3>&nbsp;Filling:</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until just 
                smooth, no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add flour, beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until 
                just incorporated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
               Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until 
               just combined (10 sec max, speed 5).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined 
                (5 sec each), and after the last one, beat just until the 
                egg is fully incorporated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pour into prepared crust.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden 
                brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle 
                slightly when you gently shake the pan.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cool the cake in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8″ 
                (Note 6), then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the 
                cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>&nbsp;Srawberry Topping:</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place chopped strawberries, vanilla, sugar and lemon juices in 
                a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Simmer for 10 minutes until strawberries breakdown.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
               Mix cornflour with water, then add into saucepan and stir.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add halved strawberries and cook for 1 minute to soften.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. 
                Will thicken as it cools.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once cool, stirl. Adjust thickness to make it the right 
                “oozing” consistency (see video, Note 7) with a tiny touch 
                of water (be careful!).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Spoon onto cheesecake so it’s covered with a single layer of 
                strawberries. Flip strawberry halves so they are facedown. 
                Refrigerate 2 hours+.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slice and serve with remaining Strawberry Sauce!
